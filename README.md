# survivor-app
This is a Disaster Management App called Survivor for managing survivors of any disaster.

## The Process
Building this app was a challenge at first, using wome instructions from our WDI class I was able to set up the database on day 1 and concentrated on getting my routes working for the rest of the time. I got help from classmates and teaching assistants and relied majorly on Web Development with Node and Express by Ethan Brown(2014).

## Overview
The Survivor-app is a web application that is used by Red-banner emergency workers to -process survivors who are brought to the Red-banner tent. The process entails, a physical examination of a patient, getting their picture, recording their medical status and fiding out if they need any equipment to make their stay more comfortable.

## Ice Box
I would love to add an upload button which will allow volunteers to take pictures of victims before they process them. I found a resource to help me with that and a module called multer, however due to time constraints I was unable to make it fully functional but wil continue to work on this goal.
